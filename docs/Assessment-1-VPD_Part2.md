# Club Membership Application

## Assessment Tasks

### PART 2

10-15 minutes to present your prototype

Role Play Participants:
  Client and Developer.

### 1. Identify each use case requirements that you need to fulfil

As an employee, I can create member details, so I can register new members.

As an employee, I can update member details, so I change existing member details.

As an employee, I can delete members, so I remove old members.

As an employee, I can see a list of members, so I know who is a member.


### 2. Confirm the completeness and correctness of the requirements using appropriate questioning and listening techniques.

I ran through the requirements that were outlined in PART 1 and it was decided 

 - user table and information was not needed in the first version of the software
 - Sign in/out was not needed
 - Anyone with a URL could access the system

### 3. Demonstrate the prototype (from Part 1) to the client and determine whether any further refinements need to be made.

### 4. Record the outcome of the presentation and any changes required in a document.

The discussion with client was noted (see #2) and the proof of concept system was then built based based from the first document and the discussion with client.
